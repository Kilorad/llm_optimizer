Rent a garage or workshop space nearby.\\n \\n5\\\\. **Construction & Assembly** (Approximately 6-12 Months): \\n  Start building based on purchased components, utilizing manuals and acquired knowledge.\\n  This includes frame assembly, engine mounting, installing control surfaces and electronics, and conducting rigorous tests.',\n",
